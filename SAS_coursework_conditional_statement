*The goal of this lab is to Conditionally execute statements and applying values;

/*1. Create a temporary data set by merging the ae and dm data sets in the course folder.
a. Assign a numeric indicator variable, with values of 0 and 1, indicating if the subject had an adverse event or not. A 1 indicates the subject had an event.
b. Create a character categorical variable, based on the serious adverse event variable, severity, and outcome variables using the table below.
c. Assign a label to the new variables.
The resulting data set should contain 1317 observations and 25 variables.*/

2. Use a PROC FREQ to check your results for the variable created in #1a. You should have 
counts for all five categories.*/

/*3. Create a temporary version of the employee_donations data set in the course folder.
a. Use the SUM function to get a total donation for the year for each observation.
b. Use the addition operator (+) to get a total donation for the year for each observation. HINT: Look at the note under the arithmetic operators table.
c. Calculate the difference between the variable from #a and #b. 
The resulting data set should contain 124 observations and 10 variables.*/

/*4. Use PROC MEANS to verify that all values of the difference variable from #3c are zero. 
Request the MIN, MAX, MEAN, SUM, and NMISS statistics. */

/*5. Create a temporary version of the learn_modalities data set in the course folder.
a. Using the DATEPART function, create a new variable to hold the date value of the 
variable called week in the data set.
b. Use a subsetting IF statement to subset to date values on or after January 1, 2021.
The resulting data set should contain 244905 observations and 10 variables.*/
