*The goal of this coursework is to generate reports with PROC REPORT.

/*1. Create a detailed report based on the learn_modalities data set in the course folder.
a. In the PROC REPORT step, use the OBS= data set option to display only the first 50 observations. 
b. Subset to only those observations from Arizona.
c. Include a column for district name, learning modality, and number of students, in that order.
d. Include a spanning header that will appear over both the learning modality and number of students columns.*/
title 'Q1 report on the learn_modalities data set';
PROC REPORT data=course.learn_modalities (obs=50);
    where state='AZ';
    column district_name ('spanning header' learning_modality student_count);
run;


/*2. Create a summary report based on the diabetes data set in the course folder.
a. Include a column for location, frame, waist, and hip, in that order. 
b. Apply the GROUP usage to location and frame.
c. Request the max statistic for waist and apply a column header.
d. Request the max statistic for hip and apply a column header.*/
title 'Q2 report on the diabetes data set';
PROC REPORT data=course.diabetes;
    column location frame waist hip;
    define location / group; 
    define frame / group; 
    define waist / 'waist_' max;
    define hip / 'hip_' max;
run;


/*3. Create a report based on the budget data set in the course folder.
a. Include department and the years 2018-2020.
b. Use the department variable as column headers. Under those headers should be the other variables. 
c. Suppress the printing of the department variable’s label by applying a blank header (‘ ‘) in the DEFINE statement.*/
title'Q3 report on the diabetes data set';
PROC REPORT data=course.budget;
    column department,(yr2018-yr2020);
    define department / across '';
run;    


/*4. Create a summary report based on the employee_donations data set in the course folder.
a. Include a column for paid by, quarter 1, quarter 2, quarter 3, and quarter 4.
b. Apply the GROUP usage to the paid by variable.
c. Apply the dollar8. format to the quarter variables. It is ok to use a FORMAT statement.
d. Apply a light yello background to the quarter 4 column.*/
title'Q4 report on the diabetes data set';
PROC REPORT data=course.employee_donations;
    column paid_by qtr1-qtr4;
    define paid_by / group ;
    define qtr1-qtr4 / format=dollar8.;
    define qtr4 / style(column)=[background=lightyellow];
run;

/*5. Create a report based on the sashelp.cars data set.
a. Use origin as a grouping variable.
b. Use type as column headers.
c. Request the n statistics under the type.
d. Suppress the printing of the label for all three report items.
e. Ensure no dots are in the final report. Print a 0 (zero). HINT: system option.*/
title'Q5 report on the diabetes data set';
PROC REPORT data=sashelp.cars;
    column origin type,n;    
    define origin / group '';
    define type / across '';
    define n /  '';
    option missing=0;
