*The goal of this lab is to generate multiple plot types using PROC SGPANEL and to create similar graphs using both PROC SGPLOT and PROC SGPANEL;

/*1. With PROC SGPANEL, create a panel of horizontal box plots using the prostate data set in the course folder.
a. Subset to a tumor size that is not -9999.
b. Panel by the treatment and stage variables.
c. Force the graphs to be in four columns. 
d. Use tumor size as the analysis variable.
e. Use the DISPLAYSTATS option to display the mean value within each graph.
f. Make the outlier marker color red.*/

    panelby treatment stage/ columns=4;
    hbox tumorsize / DISPLAYSTATS=(mean) outlierattrs=(color=red);
run;    

/*2. With PROC SGPANEL, create panel of histograms with density curves using the preemies data set in the course folder.
a. Suppress the creation of a legend, using the NOAUTOLEGEND option.
b. Panel by the sex variable.
c. Remove the variable names from the cell headings of the panel layout.
d. Use the bw variable to generate both the histogram and the density curve.
e. Apply a label of “Birth Weight” to the numeric result variable.
f. Change the color of the density curve to purple.
g. Change the row axis label to ‘Percent (%)’ and specify values of 0 to 50 by 10.*/

    density bw / lineattrs=(color=purple) ;
    label bw='Birth Weight';
    rowaxis label='Percent (%)' values=(0 to 50 by 10);
    
run;

/*3. Generate the same histograms and density curves as you did in #2, using PROC SGPLOT.
a. Use a BY statement to create one graph for each visit.
b. You’ll notice that the label of the BY variable is included in the title of the graph. This is called a ‘by line’. There is no option within PROC SGPLOT to change that, 
as there is in PROC SGPANEL. Use a system option to suppress the printing of the byline. 
c. Use this following TITLE statement to generate a title that contains the value of the visit but not the variable name/label.
