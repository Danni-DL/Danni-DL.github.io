*The goal of the coursework is to generat default ODS Graphics output and to select the desired plots.

/*1. Run a PROC UNIVARIATE on the sashelp.bweight data set.
     a. Request all available plots.
     b. Use the visit variable as the BY variable.
     c. Use the baby’s birth weight as the analysis variable.
     d. In the results, keep only the plots. Use an ODS statement to accomplish this. PROC UNIVARIATE generates two different “plots” output. Do not include the SSPlots in the results. */

/*2. Run a PROC FREQ on the dm data set in the course folder, under the course data folder.
     a. Request a combination (crosstabulation) of the armcd and race variables.
     b. Exclude the row and column percentages from the table.
     c. Within the PLOTS= option, request only the frequency plot. 
     d. Customize the frequency plot to group by the armcd variable. Note, the value you use in the GROUPBY option is dependent upon the order you list the variables in the TABLES statement.
     e. Customize the frequency plot to control the two-way layout with the cluster layout, which displays groups of adjacent bars.*/
