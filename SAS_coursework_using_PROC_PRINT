*This is a coursework from sas programming and the goal is to use PROC PRINT to view data and to use PROC FREQ to obtain counts, frequencies, and statistics;

/*1. Run PROC PRINT on the data in the sashelp.failure data set.
a. Use the cause variable as the BY variable. This will require creating a temporary sorted data set prior to the PROC PRINT step.
b. Print only the day and count variables. */
title 'table1';
PROC SORT data=sashelp.failure out=failure;
	by cause;
run;
PROC PRINT data=failure; 
    by cause;
    var day count;
run;

/*2. Run a PROC PRINT on the employee_donations data set in the course data folder.
a. Use the correct system option to print 0 (zero) instead of . (missing).
b. Suppress the printing of the observation number column.
c. Add a FORMAT statement to print the quarter variables with a dollar sign and two decimal places â€“ the dollar8.2 format.
d. Use a LABEL statement inside of PROC PRINT, to add a label for the type of payment variable. 
e. Print the variables in the order of: type of payment, recipient, then the quarter variables.
f. Include an overall sum for the quarter variables.*/
title 'table2';
option missing=0;
PROC PRINT data=course.employee_donations label noobs;    
    format qtr1-qtr4 dollar8.2;
    label paid_by="the type of payment";
    var paid_by recipients qtr1-qtr4;
run;

/*3. Determine the gender distribution (PROC FREQ) within the primary_biliary_cirrhosis data set in the course data folder.
a. Note, the primary_biliary_cirrhosis data set contains subjects that were not given any treatment.
 Use a WHERE statement to exclude those observations. 
b. Use the sex variable in the TABLES statement.*/
title 'table3';
PROC FREQ data=course.primary_biliary_cirrhosis;
    where drug ^= "not randomized";
    tables sex ;
run;
 
/*4. Using primary_biliary_cirrhosis data set in the course data folder, PROC FREQ to see the crosstabulation of sex and stage.
a. Subset to subjects given treatment and subjects under the age of 50.*/
title 'table4';
PROC FREQ data=course.primary_biliary_cirrhosis;
    tables sex*stage;
    where drug ^= "not randomized" and age<50;
run;    

/*5. Using the customer_dim data set in the course data folder, PROC FREQ to see the crosstabulation of customer type and customer group.
a. Subset to customers over the age of 50.
b. Use a second TABLES statement, changing the order of type and group. You might find one way more informative or more preferable. 
c. Use the LIST option on both TABLES statements. This provides the percent and cumulative percent values in list format.*/
title 'table5';
PROC FREQ data=course.customer_dim;
    tables customer_type*customer_group / list;
    where customer_age>50;
    
    tables customer_group*customer_type / list;
run;

/*6. Run a PROC FREQ step on the migraine data set in the course data folder using the treatment and response variables.
a. Request the sensitivity and specificity estimates.*/
title "table6";
PROC FREQ data=course.migraine;
    tables treatment*response / senspec;
run;
