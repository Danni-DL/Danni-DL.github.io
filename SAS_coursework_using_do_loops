/* the goal of the sas lab is mainly to conduct do loops and datanull.*/

/*1. Use an iterative DO loop to create a brand-new, temporary data set with one 
observation for every day of August 2024 through December of 2024.
a. In the DO statement use a date constant for the start and end values â€“ the first 
and last day. Remember: dates are numeric. This is an advantage when you 
want to iterate over days. 
b. For every day, generate a random number with a geometric distribution and a 
numeric constant of .2. HINT: There is a function that allows you to specify a 
specific distribution. 
c. You must explicitly output each date, using an OUTPUT statement.
d. The date variable should have a format applied. Choose the one you like the 
best.
The resulting data set should contain 153 observations and 2 variables.*/

/*2. Run a PROC MEANS on the data set created in #1. 
a. Subset to only records in October.
b. Use the random number you created as the analysis variable.*/

/*3. Create a temporary data set based on the sashelp.stocks data set.
a. Subset to the observation with the stock value of IBM and the date of 
02Aug2004.
b. Use a DO loop to create five observations.
c. Increase the value of adjusted close by 4% for each record.
d. Use the INTNX to increment the date value by one year (you should end up with 02Aug2005, 02Aug2006, etc.).
e. Keep on the stock, date, and adjusted close variables. 
The resulting data set should contain 5 observations and 3 variables.*/
