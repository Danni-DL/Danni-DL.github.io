*The goal of this coursework is to generate multiple plot types using PROC SGPLOT.

/*1. With PROC SGPLOT, create a horizontal bar chart using the depression data set in the course data folder.
  a. Use the education variable as the category variable.
  b. Use the bed days variable as the response variable.
  c. Request the mean statistic.
  d. The default data skin is none. Request a different skin type.*/
title 'Q1 data analysis on depression data set';
PROC SGPLOT data=course.depression ;
    
    hbar education  / response=beddays stat=mean dataskin=sheen ;
run;

/*2. With PROC SGPLOT, create overlaid vertical bar graphs using the sashelp.cars data set.
  a. Use type as the category variable for both vertical bar graphs.
  b. For the first bar graph, use the msrp variable as the response variable and the sum statistic.
  c. For the second bar graph, use the invoice variable as the response variable and the sum statistic.
  d. Set the transparency for both bar charts to .3.
  e. For the second bar graph, set a bar width of .5.*/
title 'Q2 data analysis on cars data set';
PROC SGPLOT data=sashelp.cars;
    vbar type / response=msrp stat=sum TRANSPARENCY=0.3 ;
    vbar type / response=invoice stat=sum TRANSPARENCY=0.3 barwidth=0.5;
run;

/*3. Summarize the vs data set in the course folder and store the results in a temporary data set. HINT: PROC MEANS.
  a. Suppress the printing of any output.
  b. Use the NWAY option in the PROC MEANS statement. 
  c. Use the vstestcd, vstest, visitnum, and visit variables in the CLASS statement.
  d. Use the numeric result variable from the vs data set in the VAR statement.
  e. Request the mean statistic in the OUTPUT OUT= statement. */
title 'Q3 data analysis on vs data set';
PROC MEANS data=course.vs noprint nway;
    class vstestcd vstest visitnum visit;
    var vsstresn;
    OUTPUT OUT=vs mean=mean_;
run;



/*4. Run a PROC SPLOT step on the data set created in #3.
  a. Apply the NOAUTOLEGEND option, on the PROC SGPLOT statement, to prevent a legend from being included as part of the graph. 
  b. Restrict the plot to display only the results of the heart rate vital sign. HINT: use a WHERE statement. 
  c. Create a series plot with visit variable (the character variable containing the week number) on the x axis and the mean on the y axis.
  d. Overlay a scatter plot with visit variable (the character variable containing the week number) on the x axis and the mean on the y axis.
  e. Use the MARKERATTRS option in the SCATTER statement to change the symbol to star.
  f. Use a YAXIS statement and the VALUES= option to display tick marks from 59.9 to 60.4, by .05. 
  g. Apply a label to the mean variable, of ‘Heart Rate’. */

title 'Q4 data analysis on vs data set';
PROC SgPLOT data=vs NOAUTOLEGEND;
    where vstest='Heart Rate';
    series x=visit y=mean_ ;
    scatter x=visit y=mean_ / MARKERATTRS=(symbol=star);
    yaxis values=(59.9 to 60.4 by 0.05);
    label mean_='Heart Rate';
run;
